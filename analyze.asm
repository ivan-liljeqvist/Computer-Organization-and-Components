# Consider the large loop in the the original program â€“ from the label loop to the branch bne loop. How many iterations are executed in this loop?
# The loop has 14 iterations. $s0 starts at 48 (0x30) and stops at 93 (0x5d) increasing with step 3. 
# (93-48)/3=15. The last one isn't printed. So 15-1=14
